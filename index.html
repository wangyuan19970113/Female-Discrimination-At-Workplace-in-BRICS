        <p><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.SRV.EMPL.MA.ZS?view=chart">WB data</a></p>
        <p>15-24 years old is the best period for labor employment. The unemployed rate of young female in the BRICS countries is on the rise. It is related to the slowdown of economic growth in the five countries in recent years. According to the country and region, young female in southern hemisphere countries such as Brazil and South Africa have higher employment rates.In addition to economic factors, many young women do not get jobs at this stage because of discrimination against female in the workplace.Some companies do not choose female because their boss think female won't fit into a traditionally male workplace.</p>

        <p>Under normal circumstances, the higher the proportion of service industry, the higher the level of regional economic development. As we can see from the chart below, the proportion of male in the service industry in the BRICS countries increased from 2007 to 2017, but the range was different. In contrast, the proportion of Indian male in the service sector is lower, which is related to Indian culture and gender discrimination that cannot be ignored.</p>
